# Common Workflows

> **Feature Development Workflow**

1. Describe the feature you want to build
2. Let Claude explore your codebase structure
3. Review the implementation plan
4. Claude writes the code across files
5. Test and iterate as needed
6. Create a commit with generated message

This streamlined workflow helps you ship features faster while maintaining code quality.
