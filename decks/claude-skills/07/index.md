# Practical Example: GitHub Pages

Let's see how to use Claude Code to quickly host a static site on GitHub Pages.

> **Step-by-Step**
> 1. Create a new GitHub repository for your project
> 2. Ask Claude: "Create a simple HTML page and set up GitHub Pages"
> 3. Claude creates the files and configures gh-pages branch
> 4. Push to GitHub and your site is live!

This entire workflow takes just minutes with Claude Code handling all the setup.
