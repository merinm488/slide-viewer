# How to Buy Stocks

Getting started with stock investing is easier than ever. Here's your step-by-step guide to making your first trade.

## 1. Choose an Investment Account

**Brokerage Account**
- Standard taxable investment account
- No limits on contributions
- Flexible withdrawal rules
- Tax on capital gains and dividends

**Retirement Account (IRA, 401k)**
- Tax advantages for retirement savings
- Contribution limits apply
- Early withdrawal penalties
- Tax-free or tax-deferred growth

## 2. Select a Brokerage Platform

Popular options include:
- Fidelity, Charles Schwab, E*TRADE (full-service)
- Robinhood, Webull (commission-free, app-based)
- Vanguard (low-cost, index fund focus)

## 3. Fund Your Account

Link your bank account and transfer funds. Most brokerages have no minimum to open, but you'll need money to buy stocks.

## 4. Place Your Order

**Market Order**: Buy immediately at current price
**Limit Order**: Set your maximum price to pay
**Stop-Loss Order**: Automatically sell if price drops below a point

## 5. Start Small

Consider starting with $500-$1,000 and scale up as you learn. Many brokerages offer fractional shares, so you can start with any amount!
