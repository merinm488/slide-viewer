# Building Your Portfolio

A well-constructed portfolio balances risk and reward through diversification. Here's how to build a portfolio that can weather market storms.

## The Power of Diversification

"Don't put all your eggs in one basket." Diversification means spreading your investments across different assets to reduce risk.

### What to Diversify Across

**Different Companies**
- Not just one or two stocks
- Aim for 15-30 individual stocks minimum

**Different Sectors**
- Technology, healthcare, finance, consumer goods
- Energy, industrials, utilities, real estate

**Different Asset Classes**
- Stocks (higher risk, higher return potential)
- Bonds (lower risk, steady income)
- Cash (safety, liquidity)

**Geographic Regions**
- US companies
- International developed markets
- Emerging markets

## Asset Allocation Models

| Profile | Stocks | Bonds | Cash |
|---------|--------|-------|------|
| **Aggressive Growth** | 90% | 10% | 0% |
| **Moderate Growth** | 70% | 25% | 5% |
| **Balanced** | 60% | 35% | 5% |
| **Conservative** | 40% | 50% | 10% |

## Rebalancing

Check your portfolio annually. If some investments grow faster, sell a portion and buy more of underperforming assets to maintain your target allocation.
