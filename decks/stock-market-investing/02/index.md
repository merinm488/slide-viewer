# What Is the Stock Market?

The stock market is a collection of markets where stocks (pieces of ownership in companies) are traded between investors. It's one of the most powerful wealth-building tools available.

Think of it as a giant marketplace where people buy and sell shares of businesses. When you buy a stock, you're purchasing a tiny piece of that company.

## Why Invest in Stocks?

- **Potential for growth**: Stocks historically provide higher returns than savings accounts or bonds
- **Ownership in companies**: You become a partial owner of businesses you believe in
- **Passive income**: Many stocks pay dividends, providing regular income
- **Beat inflation**: Stock returns often outpace inflation, preserving your purchasing power

## Key Concepts

- **Stock**: A share of ownership in a corporation
- **Stock exchange**: Where stocks are bought and sold (like the NYSE or NASDAQ)
- **Stock market index**: A benchmark that tracks a group of stocks (like the S&P 500)

> The S&P 500 has returned an average of about 10% annually over the long term.
