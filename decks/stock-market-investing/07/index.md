# Understanding Risk

All investing involves risk. The key is understanding what risks you face and how to manage them. Let's explore the different types of investment risk.

## Types of Investment Risk

**Market Risk**
- The overall market declines
- Affects almost all stocks
- Cannot be eliminated through diversification

**Company-Specific Risk**
- Bad news about a specific company
- Poor earnings, management issues
- Can be reduced through diversification

**Inflation Risk**
- Rising prices erode purchasing power
- Your returns don't keep up with inflation
- Stocks generally hedge against inflation long-term

**Interest Rate Risk**
- Rising interest rates can hurt stock prices
- Particularly affects growth stocks

**Liquidity Risk**
- Difficulty selling a stock quickly
- More common with small-cap stocks

## Your Risk Tolerance

Ask yourself:

1. **Age**: How many years until you need this money?
2. **Time Horizon**: Can you wait out market downturns?
3. **Financial Cushion**: Do you have emergency savings?
4. **Personality**: How do you react to market volatility?

## Risk Management Strategies

- **Diversification**: Spread your investments
- **Dollar-cost averaging**: Invest regularly regardless of price
- **Emergency fund**: Keep 3-6 months expenses in cash
- **Long-term focus**: Don't panic sell during downturns
