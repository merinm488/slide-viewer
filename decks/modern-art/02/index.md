## Impressionism (1870s-1880s)

**Revolutionary approach:**
- Painted outdoors (*en plein air*) for natural light
- Visible brushstrokes
- Everyday scenes instead of historical/religious subjects
- Captured fleeting moments and changing light

**Key works:**
- Monet - *Impression, Sunrise* (gave movement its name)
- Renoir - *Luncheon of the Boating Party*
- Degas - *The Ballet Class*
- Cassatt - *Child in a Garden*

## Cubism (1900s-1920s)

**Breaking conventions:**
- Multiple viewpoints shown simultaneously
- Fractured, geometric forms
- Rejects single-perspective realism
- Influenced by African masks and Iberian art

**Phases:**
1. **Analytic Cubism** (1909-1912) - Monochromatic, fragmented forms
2. **Synthetic Cubism** (1912-1914) - Collage, brighter colors, simpler shapes
